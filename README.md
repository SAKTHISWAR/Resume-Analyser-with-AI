## RESUME ANALYSER WITH AI
Resume screening is a critical step in the recruitment process, but manually evaluating resumes can be slow, subjective, and susceptible to oversight.Many organizations and institutions struggle to efficiently and accurately process the growing number of unstructured resumes they receive. As the demand for smart recruitment technologies increases, it becomes more challenging to analyze applicant data, identify relevant skills, and make data-driven recommendations for both recruiters and candidates.This project aims to automate and streamline resume analysis, reducing human error and saving valuable time.

## About
Manual resume screening is labor-intensive and can lead to inconsistent results, especially when dealing with large numbers of applicants. As organizations continue to receive increasingly varied resumes, conventional review methods become less reliable, contributing to delays in the recruitment process and higher chances of oversight.Without smart tools to help, recruiters might miss out on great candidates whose strengths aren’t obvious from a quick glance at their resume. This means talented people can easily slip through the cracks, and companies lose out on valuable team members.

## Features
#### Automated Resume Parsing
Extracts structured information such as name, contact details, education, skills, experience, and certifications from unstructured resume formats (PDF, DOC, DOCX).

#### Skill Extraction and Matching
Identifies technical and soft skills from resumes and matches them against job descriptions using NLP techniques.

#### AI-Based Resume Scoring
Assigns a relevance score to each resume based on skill match, experience level, education, and keywords.

#### Job Description Analysis
Analyzes job requirements to identify mandatory and preferred skills for accurate candidate matching.

#### Keyword & Semantic Matching
Uses NLP models (TF-IDF / Word Embeddings / BERT) to capture contextual meaning rather than relying only on exact keyword matches.

#### Candidate Ranking System
Automatically ranks candidates in descending order based on suitability for the given role.

#### Multi-Format Resume Support
Supports resumes in multiple formats such as PDF, Word documents, and plain text files.

#### Bias Reduction & Fair Screening
Minimizes human bias by focusing on skills, experience, and qualifications instead of personal identifiers.

#### Bulk Resume Processing
Processes hundreds or thousands of resumes simultaneously, saving recruiter time.

#### Search & Filter Functionality
Enables recruiters to filter candidates based on skills, experience, education, or score.

#### Analytics & Insights Dashboard
Provides visual insights such as skill distribution, experience levels, and candidate trends.

#### Candidate Recommendation Engine
Suggests best-fit candidates for open positions based on AI-driven analysis.

#### Feedback & Resume Improvement Suggestions (Optional)
Offers candidates insights on missing skills or keywords to improve their resumes.

#### Secure Data Handling
Ensures confidentiality and secure storage of applicant data.

#### Scalable & Customizable Architecture
Can be adapted to different industries, job roles, and recruitment workflows.
